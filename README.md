# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project involves doing analysis of airline passenger satisfaction data using Tableau. A dashboard was created to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into the factors influencing passenger satisfaction.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is `airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv`, which contains data on various factors that impact passenger satisfaction. This includes demographics, flight details, service quality metrics, and satisfaction ratings.

### Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **Gender**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **Class**: Travel class (Economy, Business, etc.).
- **Flight Distance**: Distance of the flight.
- **Inflight Service Ratings**: Ratings for various inflight services such as food, entertainment, and comfort.
- **Satisfaction**: Overall satisfaction rating (Satisfied/Neutral or Dissatisfied).


## Getting Started

1. Download the dataset `airline_passenger_satisfaction.csv` from this repository.
